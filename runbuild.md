## 6. Vite (A Modern Build Tool for Faster Development)

Before diving into Vite, it’s important to understand the concept of a **build tool** in modern web development. A build tool is a software that automates various tasks such as bundling code, optimizing assets, and preparing files for deployment. In traditional workflows, build tools like **Webpack** have been widely used, but they can sometimes be slow, especially during development.

Vite, however, is a modern **build tool** designed to address these limitations, providing **lightning-fast build speeds** and a smoother development experience. Vite is especially popular for its **fast refresh**, **instant updates**, and **optimized build process** for projects, including React and Next.js.
