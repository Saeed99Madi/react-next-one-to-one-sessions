## 1. JavaScript Basics

Key areas to focus on for JavaScript:

- **Variables and Data Types**: `let`, `const`, `var`, numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and more.
- **Functions**: Function declarations, arrow functions, and understanding `this`.
- **Control Flow**: `if`, `else`, loops (`for`, `while`), and switch statements.
- **ES6+ Features**: Destructuring, spread/rest operators, arrow functions, template literals, promises, async/await, and more.

Understanding JavaScript is essential for building React applications. The following resources will help solidify your foundational JavaScript knowledge:

- [**MDN JavaScript Guide**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)  
  A comprehensive guide on JavaScript, starting from the basics to more advanced topics.
- [**JavaScript.info**](https://javascript.info/)  
  This interactive guide covers all fundamental JavaScript concepts in depth.

### Practice Platforms

- **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)**: LeetCode offers a vast collection of coding challenges that help improve problem-solving skills. It’s a great platform to practice your JavaScript knowledge and prepare for technical interviews. You can find problems ranging from beginner to advanced, focusing on algorithms, data structures, and more.
- **[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)**: Codewars is a community-driven platform where developers can practice coding challenges (called "kata") to improve their skills. With problems of varying difficulty, Codewars offers a fun and engaging way to strengthen your JavaScript understanding through real-world coding problems.
