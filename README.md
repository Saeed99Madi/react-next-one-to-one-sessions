## 1. React Basics

To strengthen your understanding of React, I recommend starting with the following resources:

- [**Official React Docs - Main Concepts**](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)  
  This will guide you through the core concepts like JSX, props, state, and components.
- [**React for Beginners by Wes Bos**](https://reactforbeginners.com/)  
  A free course that focuses on React fundamentals and is great for a hands-on approach.

## 2. JavaScript Basics

Key areas to focus on for JavaScript:

- **Variables and Data Types**: `let`, `const`, `var`, numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and more.
- **Functions**: Function declarations, arrow functions, and understanding `this`.
- **Control Flow**: `if`, `else`, loops (`for`, `while`), and switch statements.
- **ES6+ Features**: Destructuring, spread/rest operators, arrow functions, template literals, promises, async/await, and more.

Understanding JavaScript is essential for building React applications. The following resources will help solidify your foundational JavaScript knowledge:

- [**MDN JavaScript Guide**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)  
  A comprehensive guide on JavaScript, starting from the basics to more advanced topics.
- [**JavaScript.info**](https://javascript.info/)  
  This interactive guide covers all fundamental JavaScript concepts in depth.
