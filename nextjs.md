## Why Next.js

Next.js is a powerful framework built on top of React, offering features that make it ideal for building production-ready web applications. It combines the flexibility of React with the added benefits of server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and incremental static regeneration (ISR), making it a versatile choice for developers.

### **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)**

One of the standout features of Next.js is its ability to handle both **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)** with ease. SSR allows pages to be pre-rendered on the server, providing faster page loads and improved SEO since the content is available immediately when the page is accessed. On the other hand, SSG pre-renders pages at build time, allowing for optimal performance with static content. Both methods can be used in conjunction to build applications that are both fast and SEO-friendly.

Other notable features of Next.js include:

- **File-based Routing**
- **Automatic Code Splitting**
- **Optimized Performance**
- **API Routes**

Next.js is a framework that builds on top of React. If you're focusing on Next.js 14, it's important to understand the new features, including the app folder structure:

## Next.js v14 Project Structure Explained

In Next.js v14, the project structure is designed to be simple, yet powerful enough to handle modern web development workflows. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key directories and files in a Next.js v14 project.

### 1. `src` (Source Code)

The `src` directory is where the source code of your application resides. It includes the main logic, components, pages, and configuration files. This folder is not strictly required, but it's a common practice to organize your project this way.

#### a. `app` (New in Next.js v14)

The `app` directory is the new structure introduced in Next.js v13 and continues in v14. It helps manage routing and layouts in a more modular, scalable way. This folder works with file-based routing, meaning the file structure determines how URLs are handled in the app.

- **`page.js`**: This file represents a page in your app. When you create a file in the `app` folder, it automatically becomes a route in your application.

  - For example, `app/page.js` will be your homepage (root route).
  - You can also create subdirectories under `app/` to handle nested routes, for example, `app/about/page.js` will correspond to `/about`.

- **Layouts**: You can define layouts in the `app` folder that wrap multiple pages, making it easier to share common UI elements like navigation bars or footers. Layouts can be placed in their own files like `app/layout.js`.

Example structure:

```
src/
└── app/
    ├── page.js           // Main home page
    ├── about/
    │   └── page.js       // About page
    └── contact/
        └── page.js       // Contact page
```

#### b. `components`

The `components` folder contains reusable UI components (like buttons, forms, headers, etc.) that are used throughout your application. This helps avoid code duplication and makes your codebase more modular and maintainable.

Example:

```
src/
└── components/
    ├── Header.js        // Header component
    └── Footer.js        // Footer component
```

#### c. `styles`

The `styles` folder typically holds all the global styles, CSS modules, or any other styling mechanisms your project uses (like SCSS, CSS-in-JS, etc.).

- **`globals.css`**: This file usually contains global styles that apply to the whole application.
- **CSS Modules**: Next.js also supports CSS Modules out of the box, allowing you to scope styles locally to a component.

Example:

```
src/
└── styles/
    └── globals.css     // Global CSS file
```

#### d. `lib` (Optional)

The `lib` folder is used for utility functions or libraries that are shared across the application. It might include helper functions for interacting with APIs, data manipulation, or specific services like authentication.

Example:

```
src/
└── lib/
    └── api.js          // API utility functions
```

### 2. `public` (Static Assets)

The `public` folder is where static files such as images, fonts, and other assets are stored. Anything in this folder can be accessed directly from the root of your application via the `/` path.

- **`favicon.ico`**: The favicon for your website.
- **`images/`**: Static images that you want to serve directly to users.
- **`robots.txt`**: A file that tells search engines how to crawl your site.

Example:

```
public/
├── favicon.ico         // Favicon
├── logo.png            // Logo
└── assets/
    └── banner.jpg      // Static images
```

### 3. `node_modules` (Node.js Modules)

This folder contains all the dependencies installed via npm (or yarn) for your project. When you run `npm install` or `yarn install`, this folder is automatically created to store the external libraries your project depends on.

- It is automatically managed by npm or yarn, so you generally won't need to modify anything here directly.

### 4. `next.config.js` (Next.js Configuration)

This is the configuration file where you can customize your Next.js app's behavior. You can use this file to set up custom webpack configurations, environment variables, redirects, or internationalization.

Example:

```js
module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  images: {
    domains: ["example.com"],
  },
};
```

### 5. `package.json` (Project Metadata)

This file contains information about your project, such as its name, version, dependencies, and scripts. It’s where npm/yarn manages your project’s dependencies and scripts like `start`, `build`, `dev`, and `test`.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "my-next-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^14.0.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

### 6. `.gitignore` (Git Ignore File)

This file tells Git which files or directories to ignore when pushing code to a repository. It typically includes `node_modules`, build files, and other temporary files that don’t need to be version-controlled.

Example:

```
node_modules/
.next/
out/
```

### 7. `README.md` (Project Documentation)

This is where you provide information about the project, like its purpose, how to set it up, and how to run it locally. It’s the first place developers and collaborators will look to understand how to contribute or use the project.

Example:

```
# My Next.js App

This is a Next.js application built with React.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
```

│   │   ├── Header.js
│   │   └── Footer.js
│   ├── lib/             // Utility functions
│   │   └── api.js
│   └── styles/          // Global and component-specific styles
│       └── globals.css
├── .gitignore           // Git ignore file
├── next.config.js       // Next.js configuration
├── package.json         // Project metadata and dependencies
└── README.md            // Project documentation
```

## Conclusion

Next.js v14 introduces a powerful structure that helps manage both the routing and layout of your application in a more modular way with the `app` directory. Static assets are served through the `public` folder, and all source code is kept under the `src` folder, which can include components, styles, and utilities. This organization makes it easy to scale your application as your project grows, while maintaining simplicity and modularity.

By understanding this structure, you'll be able to efficiently navigate and contribute to a Next.js project with ease.
